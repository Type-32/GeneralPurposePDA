# General Purpose PDA
I'm working on this thing as a sort-of passion project, just to mess around and learn how hardware development works.

Oh, and to also practice writing python since I haven't done so for a long time.

## Materials
- ESP32-S3-Touch-4.3-LCD from **WaveShare**
- 3D printed case (.stl files here later)
- A Type-C cable on both ends or on one end
- A computer with a USB/Type-C port

I use macOS. I don't know if this will work on Windows or Linux, but I'll try to make it work on those platforms. (If it doesn't work on other platforms)
